The only surefire way to prepare you for difficult battles in the Battle Tower is to go through difficult battles in the Battle Tower. To really understand all the variables at play, it's necessary to experience it for yourself, so don't feel bad if you lose your win streak a few times before making any significant progress! It's important to keep in mind that you learn something new with each battle, whether you win or lose.<br><br>

          The best advice for taking on the Battle Tower challenge is to use every resource <a href="https://www.serebii.net/brilliantdiamondshiningpearl/battletower/">Serebii's Battle Tower reference</a> provides to you, and use it alongside the <a href="https://eisencalc.com/">Battle Facilities Damage Calculator</a> as outlined in <a href="/Pages/preparation-strategy.html">Preparation & Strategy</a>. It's silly not to use these resources no matter what your experience level is. These are your best tools for success in the Battle Tower, and eventually they're going to get you comfortable with guessing the possible range of damage your team's moves can do against an opponent under all kinds of different circumstances, so it can only help you in the long-run as well.<br><br> 

          Now, let's get into a few general tips of battle that will help you not just in your Battle Tower run, but also in the world of competitive battle.

          <h3>Don't be afraid to switch out your Pokémon.</h3>
          In the story mode of most Pokémon games, players get used to never switching out their Pokémon until they've fainted or they've defeated the opposing Pokémon. However, it's very common for players to switch out their Pokémon for another in the competitive world for a better match-up, and you shouldn't be afraid to use this strategy either. Some of the AIs in the Battle Tower do this too - especially Palmer in the Singles battles, and trainers in the Master Class battles. If you know for sure Pelipper will go down to that Electivire's Thunder Punch, maybe hit it with Scald with Kingdra and switch in Raikou to take that Thunder Punch damage (of which it would take <i>very</i> little, thanks to its Electric resistance).<br>

The top half says 'Opposing Pokemon with 50% accuracy moves' and has a picture of the Avengers character Hawkeye beneath it. The bottom half says 'My Pokemon with 95% accuracy moves' and a picture of a Stormtrooper beneath it."><h3>Do not underestimate the power of luck.</h3>
          There is what's known as "cheese" in the Battle Tower, where NPCs will get insanely lucky with moves like Guillotine and Fissure - moves with incredibly low accuracy but result in an OHKO if they hit. But that's not the only "cheese" in the Battle Tower - NPCs also get lucky with critical hits, flinches, and burns, so the potential for unlucky losses for your team is everywhere. <i>Don't forget about this.</i> Sometimes your loss is down to poor luck, not a lack of skill on your part. At the same time, remember to be grateful for the times <i>you</i> get lucky! Critical hits, flinches, burns, and freezes can happen to <i>your</i> advantage as well, and sometimes it feels like it happens at just the right time too!

          <h3>It's okay that you can't counter every threat.</h3>
          In fact, it's impossible for a single team to counter every possible threat it could face in the Battle Tower, or in the competitive world. The best strategy for success for any team is to build a team that can win <b>consistently</b>. Not effortlessly, but consistently. If it takes you 30 minutes to win a battle against an NPC in the Battle Tower - that's okay! You're learning, it was probably a tricky battle, and you were taking the time you needed to make sure you won that battle. Take the time you need while you have it available to you, and don't rush it if you don't have to. Some battles are going to be <i>very close</i> wins that make you incredibly nervous. But every time you win those battles, you gain more experience, and it'll make you smarter and faster for the next tough battle. You can't counter every threat with supereffective attacks. Because of the prevalence of Water-type Pokémon in the Battle Tower, you'll probably go up against opponents often where you have no advantageous moves. Just make sure you don't hit Storm Drain Gastrodon with a Water move!

          <h3>Learn how to analyze your opponent's team.</h3>
          It's important to start getting good at this while you have the resource of Serebii's Battle Tower guide available to you, especially if you'd like to go into live competitive battle. Getting familiar with the types of teams you see in the Battle Tower will allow you to recognize the abilities and ideal movesets available to all kinds of different Pokémon. Additionally, you'll quickly become familiar with certain strategies that are very threatening for your team, which is a good instinct to have.<br><br>

          First, make sure you look at the abilities of the opposing team and that you understand how those abilities work. The nice thing about Serebii's reference is that all abilities and moves are also links to their own pages that describe their effects in battle! Certain abilities should be a flag to you that this Pokémon will require special attention to defeat. Abilities like Sturdy, Water Absorb, Storm Drain, and Swift Swim can be problematic if you're not careful. <br><br>

          Next, look at your opponent's held items and make sure you understand how those work. Your biggest problems are going to be items like Focus Sash, Leftovers, berries, and Bright Powder, so it's best to work out a plan to KO those Pokémon quickly.<br><br>

I'll remember you all in therapy.' The text beneath this image says 'When a Pokemon keeps using Double Team and you can't hit it.'">
          Analyze each Pokémon's moveset. Don't ignore status-affecting moves - moves like Double Team, Recover, and other stalling/evasion-based moves can be devastating for your team, and allow your opponent to easily sweep yours if you don't take out that threat as quickly as possible.<br><br>

          A very important factor is speed. Comparing your Pokémons' speed to your opponents' is huge - it could mean the difference between life and death for a teammate with a 4x weakness. For example, Rhyperior could outspeed Pelipper, but Kingdra can for sure outspeed Rhyperior. If Rhyperior has access to Thunderbolt, it could OHKO Pelipper. It's imperative, in this case, for Kingdra to OHKO Rhyperior before it has a chance to OHKO Pelipper.

          <h3>Try to plan ahead.</h3>
          An especially important stategy when you have a Pokémon using any of the Choice items (Choice Band/Specs/Scarf), but also good to keep in mind for any strategy. For example, Raikou is outfitted with Choice Specs, so he'll be locked into the first move he uses when he enters battle. It might be tempting to nuke the opponent with Thunder - but what happens if Rain goes away in a turn or two? Thunder's accuracy would be reduced to 70% again. Even if it doesn't go away within a couple turns, it's possible the opponent could be immune to damage to Thunder - any Ground or Steel-type Pokémon will be completely immune to the powerful attack. If that happens, do you feel confident in switching out Raikou for another teammate? Would they be able to take the oncoming damage without getting OHKOd? Or should you think about using a different, less powerful attack that would give you a better chance of netting a win?<br><br>

          If you don't have any Choice items, it's still a good idea to plan ahead. For example, you might face a team that has some bulky Pokémon out first, and you can see Garchomp will be sent out later as their last Pokémon. You know for sure that Kingdra will be the best Pokémon to deal with Garchomp as a threat, as it's the only one on your team that'd be able to outspeed the land shark and OHKO it in the same move. It might be a good idea to switch out Kingdra for Scizor to ensure Kingdra will live long enough to deal with the threat of Garchomp. <br><br>

          Smogon's <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dp/articles/intro_comp_pokemon">Introduction to Competitive Pokémon</a> sums it up best:
          
          <blockquote><b>“</b> A large part of competitive Pokemon deals with the ability to analyze situations and form a plan to deal with both short and long term threats, while at the same time executing your own strategy. It is easy to focus only on the Pokemon you are currently facing, but it is imperative that you learn to consider all of your opponent's possible plays in both the short and long term.</blockquote>

          And that's it! You should now feel prepared to take on the Battle Tower. And, if you enjoy it, consider doing live competitive battle against real people on Pokémon Showdown!
