One of the most important aspects to being successful in competitive battle is knowing how to put together a good team. This is a skill that doesn't  have an exact science, but there are a few good rules to follow.<br><br>

          <h3>A team should (generally) have high base stats.</h3>
          While this isn't a hard rule (none of these are hard rules), it's usually a very good idea to pick Pokémon that have high base stats. Let's take a look at a few examples.<br><br>

          <div class="team-container">
            <div class="pokeimg"><h2 style="color:var(--electric);">OKAY</h2>
              <img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/luxray.jpg" alt="A picture of the electric lion Pokémon Luxray."><br>
          <b><u>Base Stats - Total</b></u>: 523<br>
          <b>HP</b>: 80 / <b>Attack</b>: 120 / <b>Defense</b>: 79<br>
          <b>Sp. Atk</b>: 95 / <b>Sp. Def</b>: 79 / <b>Speed</b>: 70<br>

          <div align="justify">Luxray is a very popular choice for the average main story team in Pokémon BDSP because it can be found in Route 1, its stats aren't terrible, and it looks pretty darn cool. However, it's quite frail with low defenses, and with its disappointing speed stat it wouldn't stand a chance in the competitive scene, where it's vital for your Pokémon to have a shot at outspeeding your opponent. Even though Luxray's attack stat is excellent, it can't <i>use</i> that attack if it's killed in its first turn. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="pokeimg"><h2 style="color:var(--grass);">BETTER</h2>
            <img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/avif/raikou.avif" alt="A picture of the electric tiger Pokémon Raikou."><br>
          <b><u>Base Stats - Total</b></u>: 580<br>
          <b>HP</b>: 90 / <b>Attack</b>: 85 / <b>Defense</b>: 75<br>
          <b>Sp. Atk</b>: 115 / <b>Sp. Def</b>: 100 / <b>Speed</b>: 115<br>

          <div align="justify">Even though Raikou only has 60 extra base stat points, it has a far more favorable stat spread instead of trying to be about the same in every stat like Luxray. You can tell immediately that Raikou was designed to be a very fast special attacker, and that's exactly what it does best in the Battle Tower. It's often better to use a Pokémon that has a lot of stats piled into one or two areas than for it to have fewer stats spread in every area. </div>
          </div>
          </div><br>

          It's usually a good idea to use Pokémon with 600 base stats, as this is typically the cut-off for normal, non-legendary Pokémon as well as the cut-off for usable legendaries. By usable, I mean Pokémon not banned in the Battle Tower for having unusually high base stats (such as Dialga, Palkia, and Arceus). However, there are exceptions! It's not unheard of for people to use underutilized Pokémon with high potential that others would underestimate at first glance, such as Park Se Jun's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224822/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/pokemon-vgc-world-championship-se-jun-park/" alt="An article that describes Park Se Jun's Championship win using his innovative choice of Pachirisu.">use of Pachirisu</a> in the 2014 World Championships. 
          
          <h3>A team should be well-balanced.</h3>
          <img src="https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aqG2Zmj_700b.jpg" style="float:left;border:none;max-width:250px;" alt="A four-paneled comic. In the first panel, Garchomp appears with red eyes and asks, 'Who dares beseech the great land shark dragon?' In the second panel, a Donphan looks nervously up at Garchomp while it resumes its threats, 'I will rip you apart, limb-from-limb, and leave you-'. In the third panel, the text displays, 'Donphan used Ice Shard! It's super effective!' The final panel shows Donphan standing next to a gravestone with text reading, 'Garchomp f_cking died.'">While it might be tempting to use a team like Garchomp, Latios, and Dragonite - all Pokémon with 600 base stats, access to some of the most powerful moves in the game, and each fast enough to sweep most opponents - it wouldn't actually be a good idea because each of them share the same weaknesses: Ice and Dragon. In fact, <u>two</u> out of the three take <b>4x</b> damage from Ice attacks! A well-balanced team made up of Pokémon of different types can allow you to avoid devastating weaknesses like this. <br><br>

          Additionally, it's not a bad idea for each team member to have a separate purpose. In Singles, you'll always have a leading Pokémon (same with Doubles, except it's two), and it's a popular strategy for that lead to be a fast sweeper. A team with great spread is Gengar, Gyarados, and Garchomp (The 3 G's!). Gengar, the lead, is the most vulnerable with 4 weaknesses, but it also has 2 immunities and 4 resistances - <i>and</i> it's so fast it can outspeed most opponents before they get in a good hit anyway. If Gengar fails, Gyarados and Garchomp more than make up for the loss, depending on how it occurred. If the opponent was faster than Gengar, Garchomp equipped with Choice Band should be able to out-speed it. If it was anything else, Gyarados (with only two weaknesses) is an excellent choice, with access to a great variety of powerful moves.

          <h3>A team should have good synergy with each other.</h3>

          Perhaps most important for Doubles, but also good to keep in mind for Singles, a team's synergy is vital to its success. Using a combination like Pelipper and Kingdra - where Pelipper's ability Drizzle will boost Kingdra's speed thanks to its Swift Swim ability - can allow a team to become even more powerful when working together. Moves a Pokémon can use that directly benefit its partner are a fantastic way to strategically take down opponents. <br><br>

In the first panel, Salamance and Tyranitar gape in terrified amazement, while in the second panel Garchomp eyes its partner, Pachirisu, nervously. In the third panel, the Pachirisu casually holds up a finger to stop a Draco Meteor while cheerfully chewing a Sitrus Berry at the same time.">
          Another example of great synergy is Park Se Jun's aforementioned Pachirisu, meant to partner with Gyarados or Garchomp, as it's equipped with the move Follow Me. This move will force incoming attacks to hit the user instead of its intended target, allowing its partner to remain unharmed. With the electric squirrel's beefed-up defenses and Sitrus Berry as a held item, it became a remarkable support Pokémon. <br><br>

          At the end of the day though, the choice comes down to you! <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/stat/all.shtml" alt="A link to Serebii's website, specifically the Pokédex page for Gen 8 Pokémon with Pokémon and their stats listed from greatest to lowest.">Serebii</a> is a fantastic resource for choosing a Pokémon with high base stats, while <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/pokemon/" alt="A link to Smogon's website, specifically the Pokédex page.">Smogon</a> is a great competitive battle resource for outlining a good strategy for said Pokémon, if you'd like to get an idea for how to use them.<br><br>
