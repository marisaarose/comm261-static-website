Breeding is one of the basic mechanics of every Pokémon game - and it's also one of the most essential tools to building a competitive team. Through the years, the games have introduced more features that allow you to control the stats, nature, and moves of your Pokémons' offspring. But there are a few things you should decide before you head to the nearest daycare in your game.<br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Decide your Pokémon team, their builds, and movesets.</b> Because breeding can take some time, you should know exactly the Pokémon you want before you start breeding for them. You'll want to make sure you know the nature, ability, and moves for your team, and a great way to plan this is through the <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder" alt="A link to the team-building page of Pokémon Showdown.">Teambuilder</a> feature in Pokémon Showdown. Make sure you don't choose a Pokémon's Hidden Ability, unless you know for certain you already have a female Pokémon of that species with that Hidden Ability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Look up each Pokémon on <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/" alt="A link to the Gen 8 Pokédex on Serebii.">Serebii</a> and take note of how to obtain their movepool.</b> Some Pokémon can only obtain certain moves as Egg Moves, which are moves a Pokémon must be born with. There's nothing worse than finding out <i>after</i> you've already bred the perfect Pokémon that a move you chose is an Egg Move. Also confirm that the move you chose is obtainable for a Pokémon in the game you're playing in.
            </li>
          </ul><br>

          Next, you'll need to make sure you have a female Pokémon of the species you want and a male Pokémon of the same species or <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/egg/bug.shtml" alt="A link to Serebii's page for the Bug egg group, where there's also a drop-down menu to choose the egg group you want to view.">Egg Group</a>. Alternatively, you can breed the female Pokémon with a Ditto instead.<br>

          <h3>Egg Moves</h3>

          The first thing you should determine when selecting Pokémon to breed is whether or not your Pokémon needs an Egg Move. If so, you'll need to find a Pokémon in the female's Egg Group that has that move. For example, if you want a Garchomp with Iron Head in BDSP, you'll need to breed a female Gible/Gabite/Garchomp with a male in the Dragon or Monster Egg Group that has the move Iron Head. You can find a Pokémon that learns the desired move by looking up the move on <a href="https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh" alt="A link to the the AttackDex page on Serebii.">Serebii's AttackDex</a>. A viable breeding partner would be a male Aron/Lairon/Aggron, which learns Iron Head naturally by level 28 and is in the Monster Egg Group. Breeding a female Gible and a male Aron together would result in a child with the move Iron Head. If you don't get a female offspring in your first shot, keep trying until you get a female. Once you get a female, you will use that Gible as your new breeding female.

          <h3>Nature</h3>
          A Pokémon's nature during breeding is normally completely random, but can be controlled by a Held Item called an Everstone. Give an Everstone to the parent with the nature you want to pass down, and its offspring will have a 100% chance of having that parent's nature.

          <h3>Ability</h3>
          Unfortunately, a Pokémon's ability is totally random if they have more than one ability they can have, so you'll just have to cross your fingers on those RNG odds in order to get the Pokémon with the ability you want! Most Pokémon have two abilities they could possibly have (excluding the Hidden Ability), so the odds are usually 50/50.
          
          <h3>Perfect IVs</h3>
          The trickiest bit of the breeding process is making sure your Pokémon has perfect IVs. Sometimes, certain strategies don't require your Pokémon to have perfect IVs in <i>all</i> six stats, but they should have perfect IVs in in HP, Speed, Def, Sp. Def, and whatever type of attack they specialize in. A special attacker will not use their attack stat, so there's no need to make sure it's perfect. <br><br>

          <div align="center"><img src="https://squadstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-obtaint-5-iv-pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl.jpg" alt="An image showing a player in BDSP riding their bike in Solaceon Town with a screenshot of a Magikarp with 5 Best IVs (Sp. Atk is Decent) pasted on top."></div>

          A lot of the process of getting perfect IVs takes time, as it's based on RNG odds. First, check the IVs of your parent Pokémon using the IV Checker, which you can get by talking to an NPC at the Battle Tower. From then on, you can check any of your Pokémons' IVs through your Pokémon Boxes. If one of your parent Pokémon has an IV that says "Best", give that Pokémon a <a href="../Subpages/breeding-items.html" alt="A link to the Breeding Items page of Blitz.">power item</a> of that stat. This will guarantee they pass that stat down to their offspring. <br><br>
          
          As soon as you get an offspring that has more than one stat that has "Best!", use it as a new breeding parent and have it hold the Destiny Knot item, which will make it 100% likely for it to pass 5 of its 6 IVs from its parents. This means BOTH parents need to have good IVs, not just one, as it pulls 5 stats from their combined total of 12 stats. Ideally, after an hour or so of breeding, you should have two parents with Best IVs in almost all stats - one holding Destiny Knot to pass on 5 of those IVs and the other holding an Everstone to pass on that ideal nature. Keep going until you get an offspring with Best IVs in five stats - the one stat that's not perfect should be Attack or Special Attack, whichever one your Pokémon won't be using.<br><br>

          Once you have your perfect Pokémon, it's time to get to training to secure the rest of its movepool! <br><br>
