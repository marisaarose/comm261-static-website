          If you're interested in dipping your toes in the world of Pokémon competitive battle, but you're hesitant to jump into an online battle right away, there are a few good places to start to see if you even like more challenging battle, but perhaps the best (and lowest stakes) way is through GameFreak's latest remakes of the Sinnoh region.

          <h3>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl</h3>
          The latest remakes in the franchise, BDSP is a very loyal recreation of the original games, updated with everything in 3D and smoother visuals. A player can expect the usual routine from these games of battling trainers and defeating gyms - all the way up until you get to the Elite Four. From there, many players were shocked to find the Elite Four's and fan-favorite champion Cynthia's teams had been upgraded significantly from their original iterations. Cynthia from BDSP is regarded as the most difficult champion battle from any game, remake or otherwise. <br><br>

          <div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfbViXnZ8-k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

          If you beat Cynthia no problem, then that's a good sign you might enjoy competitive battle. The post-game story unlocks the Battle Tower located in the Battle Park, a challenge that was upgraded similarly to Cynthia's team. In order to earn one of five Trainer Stars on your Trainer Card, you must defeat 100 trainers <i>in a row</i> in the Battle Tower. All trainers in the tower are outfitted with teams that are specifically designed for competitive play. Their Pokémon have max EVs, perfect IVs, ideal natures, tricky held items, and fantastic movesets that will demolish your team if you're not similarly prepared. <br><br>

          A casual trainer who only knows about battling from playing through the story of Pokémon games will not be prepared to challenge the Battle Tower. Here are the specific steps that should be taken to be prepared:<br><br>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Learn how to build a competitive team.</b> In competitive battle, it's important to have Pokémon on your team that have high stats and a favorable stat spread. Your Pokémon should be able to work together well - especially important if you're doing the Doubles challenge - and should consist of Pokémon with different typing. It's all fun and games having a team with a bunch of Dragon-types - until you face a beefy opponent like Milotic equipped with Ice Beam!
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Breed or catch your team.</b>  If a Pokémon is able to breed, it's definitely most ideal to breed a perfect team member as opposed to catching and training one. However, some powerful Pokémon - like common Battle Tower legendaries Raikou and Suicune - cannot breed and must instead be trained to level 100 to obtain perfect IVs. In this step, it's important to consider the moveset you want for your Pokémon, as some only have access to certain moves as Egg Moves, which they'll need to obtain from a parent that has that move. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>EV Train your team.</b> Ideally, your Pokémon are level 1 because they've been bred, which makes your job very easy. If not, then you'll need to use the berries found throughout Sinnoh in order to reduce their base stats to 0 and max their preferred stats after that. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Work out a strategy and prepare.</b> In the average battle where you're confident you'll defeat your opponent, what's your strategy? Do you hope to outspeed your opponent and defeat them with a powerful move? What happens if their typing allows them to resist your attack? This stage works out learning what your team is vulnerable to and how you could prepare to prevent a loss. Held items are significant to the success of many teams, and it's important to choose the right one. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Battle!</b> You'll learn something from every battle, especially the more difficult they are. This step involves using the resources available to you online to get comfortable battling trainers in the Battle Tower. 
            </li>
          </ol>

          Some of these steps don't have to be completed in any particular order while others (like Breeding) have to be done early. But you may find it easier to decide a strategy first and then pick Pokémon for your team that fit that strategy. <br><br>
